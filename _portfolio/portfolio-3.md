We Implemented a whole procedure of QPSK: Binary data generator, Symbol mapping, Up-sampling, Pulse-shaping filter, Bandpass modulation, Bandpass demodulation, Matched filter, Sampling, Symbol detection, BER calculation

The diagram above is the passband transmission process. The images below are changes in the form of signal during passband transmission process.

We also visulized the BER graph of the designed passband transmission system
